# Loancal culator
This is script to run a financial calculator in a local hmtl file.

You input different variables and change the sliders to adapt to your specific situation.

You are able to see a breakdown of your expenses, remaining income, loan repayment and other variables.

There are three graph, showing (1) the schedule of your repayment, (2) your salary breakdown and finally (3) the amount of interest on the loan until it has been repayed.

Make sure you do not run it multiple times as this will slow down the efficiency of the calculations.
